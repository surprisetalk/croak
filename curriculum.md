# Curriculum

TODO: GIVE THEM ALGORITHMS -- NOT FACTS
TODO: in doing/images/symbols, they should cover ALL of mathematics
TODO:   before they start images, they should intuitively understand calc


## Doing: Knowing with Your Hands

TODO: generating things from simple rules
TODO: repetition is key
TODO: quizzes/tests are finding the next step in the sequence
TODO:   make them do a few examples, eg how many squares with edge of length n
TODO:     make them do up to n=5, and then ask them to predict what 6 and 7 are
TODO: measuring! experiments!
TODO: only enough symbols to communicate
TODO: RELATIVE operations -- get to destination by small steps
TODO: feedback loops!

### Stage 1

TODO

Goals:
- Values
  - [ ] counting arbitrarily large quantities of things
  - [ ] sequences and series
  - [ ] true & false (boolean values)
  - [ ] height, weight, quantity, length, weight (dimensional analysis)
- Structures
  - [ ] groups
  - [ ] corners & edges of shapes
- Processes
  - [ ] greater than & less than (comparison)
  - [ ] addition & subtraction (comparison)
  - [ ] acting out recipes (algorithms)
  - [ ] making up recipes (algorithms)
  - [ ] physics & movement (differential equations)


## Images: Knowing with Your Eyes

TODO: drawing pictures with simple rules


## Symbols: Knowing with Your Mind
