  Conventional math notation is terrible for humans, and even worse for computers.
  
  TODO: symbols are narratives with radicals, like chinese

** Notation Rules
   
   TODO: functions should be verbs (or something close)
   TODO: non-functions should be nouns
   
   TODO: packages/envs/documents are declaritive, ie order doesn't matter

    TODO: make the "::=" into a function hehe
    
*** Environment
    
**** Assert
     
     Asserts are usually used for function declarations and type descriptions.
     We assign variables by asserting that some variable is actually the same as a function.
     Elsewhere, we can assert that the function is only valid under particular type guidlines.
     And in another place, we can assert that the function behaves in a different way with different types than the original declaration, if they don't contradict the type declaration.
     
     TODO: consider making theorems, lemmas, propositions, etc.
     TODO:  they're all asserts, but help with organization
     
     TODO: also consider non-evaluating expressions for "exercises for the reader"
     
     TODO: assertions can be any expression that simplifies to boolean?
     
**** Exemplify
     
     This is for things that are true, but aren't important for advancing the narrative.
     
**** Conject
     
     This is for something unknown to be true, and not demanding immediate attention.
     
**** Query / Try
     
     This is for things that we want to know -- useful for interpreters and feedback.
